- Install **Docker** on your raspberry Pi.

- Install **docker-compose** on your raspberry Pi.

- In your home Pi folder,

  - Create a folder `MT302`

  - Create a folder `wordpress` in your `MT302` folder

  - Inside the `wordpress` folder, create a file `docker-compose.yml`

    Cut and paste the following code into that file

```
version: '3.3'

services:
   db:
     image: hypriot/rpi-mysql
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress
     networks:
       - wpsite

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:latest
     ports:
       - '80:80'
     restart: always
     volumes: ['./:/var/www/html']
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress	
     networks:
       - wpsite
networks:
   wpsite:
volumes:
   db_data:
```

- Modify the file so that:
  - your Pi is mapping its wordpress port 8000 to port 80
  - your pi is mapping the mysql port 33060 to port 3306
  - the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is your userid/username (first part of your email address)
  - the MYSQL_DATABASE is u<student number>.
    - for instance if your student number is 040123456 the db name is `u040123456`
  - the MYSQL_USER is your userid/username (first part of your email address)
  - the MYSQL_PASSWORD is mywordpress

- Once the file is saved, issue the following command:

â€‹		`COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=200`

- Create the container (it may take a few minutes).

  - If you get a timeout error, recreate the container after a few seconds using the `--force-recreate` option.

- From the `MT302` folder, issue the `tree` command and save the output to a file named `mt.txt`.

- From the `MT302` folder, issue the `clear` command .

- From the `MT302` folder, issue the following commands one by one 

  ```
  date
  ls -als
  hostname -i
  docker ps -a
  docker images
  ```

   Take a screenshot of the resulting window `screen1.png`.

- Take a screenshot of the output of the command that displays which tcp port the Pi is listening to. `screen2.png`

- From your laptop, connect to the Pi wordpress site and set up wordpress with values of your choice for the site title, username and password. Once wordpress is installed, log on to wordpress.

  - Take a screenshot of the Wordpress admin site and a screenshot of the site itself. The 2 screenshots must show the IP of the Pi in the address bar. `screen3.png` (admin) and `screen4.png` (site)

- On your Pi, find the IP address that has been assigned to the database container:

  - Take a screenshot of the command used and its result. `screen5.png`

- Connect to the mySql server using a TCP connection to that IP address. Access the container via Bash  then connect to mysql.

  - Take a screenshot of the command used and its result. `screen6.png`
